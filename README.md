# Yahtzee
A simple JavaScript version of the famous dice game.

## Browser
Mainly tested in Firefox, but I intend to support multiple browsers. Sometimes I also test with Chromium.

## TODO
* Better 'banner'
* Align the 'board' or display dice in a different way.
* Improve interface in general

## Instructions
Just download the repo and open yahtzee.html in a browser.
